This is a simple copy version of angry birds game made my me and my friend Protik Roy as a project of level-1 term-1 at BUET.

The goal here is simple. Destroy all the blocks. No, not pigs, only the blocks. There are four kinds of birds. You can select 5 birds of any order. Next, you take part in the mission with your army.

Do check the help window before you begin to play. All the instructions are there.

Disclaimer:
Of course, there are lots of issues and bugs here. Also, we haven't complete making it yet. But, as this was our first project of our life, we did give it a try. 

Hope, you will enjoy. (Though, I know you won't).
